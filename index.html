                        <h2>Culture and Value</h2>
                        <p >Sri Lankans enjoy a unique, humble and artistic lifestyle and they deeply enjoy entertaining and touching hearts with their hospitality which has been known for centuries. Culture and values of Sri Lanka is based around the fusion of traditional forms of art, dance and music. It is one that fascinates many due to its uniqueness and mystifying diversity. Nourished by Buddhism in the early 2nd century B.C and also influenced by ancient Indian invasions, the early tribes of the Yaksha and Naga cultured the inhabitants of this tiny island before 300 B.C. using architecture, agriculture and irrigation. </p>
                        <p>The small nation saw the rise and fall of many great and powerful kings who lead the people and developed the country with their bravery and intelligence. With the fall of the kings came the colonization of the western world when Sri Lanka experienced Portuguese, Dutch and British rule throughout the early 16th to the mid 20th centuries. This introduced democracy, modern education, legal and commercial agriculture systems and added more value to Sri Lanka culture making it even more diverse. </p>
                        <p>Customs and traditions are deeply ingrained in Sri Lankan society and have been passed on from one generation to the next, over a period of 2,500 years. These traditions are intertwined with day-to-day life of the island's four ethnic groups, the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and Burghers and their religions, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity. The traditional greeting is with clasped palms, a head nod followed by the words 'Ayubowan' which translates to 'May you live long'. The equivalent greeting in Tamil is 'Vanakkam', whilst the Muslims will say 'Assalamu Alaikum'. </p>

                        <h2>The Arts</h2>
                        <p>In architecture, sculpture, and painting, Sri Lanka's traditions extend far back into antiquity. The remnants of ancient works restored and preserved at archaeological sites, while reflecting Indian influences, also bear testimony to the inspiration derived from Buddhism. Classical literature, too, presents a blend of stylistic influences from India with Buddhist themes. Since the beginning of the 20th century, with the literati being exposed to European literature, local creative writing has acquired greater diversity in style and has become more secular in content. </p>
                        <p>In the performing arts there are several Sinhalese and Tamil folk traditions and a host of recent imports and imitations. Among the folk dance forms, for example, one finds the highly refined Kandyan dancing, which has been associated over several centuries with state ceremony and religious ritual in and around the historic hill capital of Kandy. The more improvised “devil dancing” is performed at healing rites and exorcisms. In drama, modernized versions of folk theatre share the limelight with modern original works and adaptations from Western dramatists. Both Indian and Western influences are strongly apparent in the popular forms of music.</p>

                        <h2>Ayurveda</h2>
                        <p> Ayurveda is becoming a famous household name and an increasing demand on Sri Lanka tours, with the fast-growing interest in “alternative medicine”. Part transcendental and part therapeutic, it is an ancient system of medicine developed in Sri Lanka over 5000 years ago. The name is derived from two conjoined words in the ancient holy language of Sanskrit; 'Ayuh' which means life and 'Veda' which means science or knowledge. So, Ayurveda is the science of healthy living. It has two aims to preserve health and to cure a body afflicted by disease.</p>
                        <p> Ayurveda is more than a system of herbal medicine. It is a way to a healthy and long life and can complement modern medicine. Ayurveda treats the mind, body and soul and looks at an individual as a whole entity and works on the basis that the mind and body affect each other, and work together to overcome disease. Fragrant herbs and warm oils together with healing massages to stimulate nerves and senses are the essentials of Ayurveda. Total relaxation overcomes the body and mind as they heal as one. </p>
                        <p> There are so many places of peace and relaxation where tourists can be provided Ayurvedic treatment throughout the island. </p>
